= SGE4VFX =

An attempt to make SGE more usable for VFX houses.

== Install ==

This doesn't cover doing the actual SGE install.  Have a look at
Sun/Oracle/whoever own's it this week's website for that.

I've created queues called:
farm.q
workstations.q
all.q

and a parallel environment associated with all those queues called:
pe1

also, as written in the scripts README, you'll need to add the prolog and
epilog scripts to those queues

Once SGE's set up...
Go through the steps in the db/README then webui/README and once you're done,
use scripts/gridsub to submit stuff (as described in scripts/README)

== ToDo ==

Add tab pages then merge into master
