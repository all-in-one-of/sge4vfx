= SGE4VFX =

An attempt to make SGE more usable for VFX houses.

== Install ==

This doesn't cover doing the actual SGE install but there are a couple of bits
that need to be set up in order for these scripts to work.  Have a look at
Sun/Oracle/whoever own's it this week's website for that.

=== Queues ===
I've created queues called:
farm.q
testing.q
all.q

=== PE ===
and a parallel environment associated with all those queues called:
pe1
This is used to allow jobs to request multiple slots on a machine

=== Checkpointing ===
You need to create a checkpointing object with the following settings:
Name: relocate_on_suspend
Interface: USER_DEFINED
All commands: NONE
Checkpoint When: On Shutdown of Execd and also On Job Suspend
Checkpoint Signal: NONE
This needs to be added to the referenced checkpoint objects on all the queues
At the moment, gridsub submits all jobs with this checkpoint config.  Maybe
that's bad.  Needs to be thought about more...

=== Prolog Epilog ===
also, as written in the scripts README, you'll need to add the prolog and
epilog scripts to those queues

=== Load Sensors ===
for workstation rendering, in the scripts folders you'll find logged_in.sh
In the cluster config, this must be added as a load sensor script for all the
machines you want to use for desktop rendering.  It checks whether anyone's
logged into X.
Add xlogin as a complex resource as follows:
xlogin xlogin INT >= NO NO 0 0
Under the farm.q, add the desktop machines and set a suspend threshold of 1 for
xlogin.  I've set the jobs suspended per interval to 30 because that's a higher
number than we have cores in any of our machines.

=== Other ===
other SGE settings I've chosen to modify include:

* Setting up a share tree priority configuration
* Setting reschedule_unknown to 00:03:00 and max_unheard to 00:03:00
* Setting rerun jobs on farm.q (I'll probably set this on all queues)

Once SGE's set up...
Go through the steps in the db/README then webui/README and once you're done,
use scripts/gridsub to submit stuff (as described in scripts/README)

== ToDo ==

Add tab pages then merge into master
