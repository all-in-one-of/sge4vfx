=== DB Setup ===

====  Postgres ====

I've gone with a Postgres database using the postgres 8.4 RPMs for CentOS
In this directory you'll find the structure dump.  I'm very very new to postgres
and I'm pretty sure I'm making bad choices when it comes to priveleges and perms
hence the TODO

1) Create a passwordless user called 'sge'
2) Apply the dump script

You'll need the psql client on your workstations and renderboxes too

This I really know almost nothing about so if someone can help here it'd be much
appreciated.

==== TODO ====

Sort out permissions/priveleges/users/pg_hba stuff
