=== DB Setup ===

====  Postgres ====

I've gone with a Postgres database using the postgres 8.4 RPMs for CentOS
In this directory you'll find the structure dump.  I'm very very new to postgres
and I'm pretty sure I'm making bad choices when it comes to priveleges and perms
hence the TODO

1) Create a passwordless user called 'sge'
2) Apply the dump script

You'll need the psql client on your workstations and renderboxes too

This I really know almost nothing about so if someone can help here it'd be much
appreciated.

==== Table Descriptions ====

Jobs contains what SGE calls jobs.  They're made up of tasks.  The task table is
populated when a job is created.

Tasks contains what SGE calls tasks from array jobs.  This table has a foreign
key constraint against the Jobs table so when the job is removed, all tasks are
deleted.

Job_Extras contains key/value pairs that can be used to record extra information
useful for a job.  For example, the stdout and stderr paths, or the number of
automatic retries to attempt.

==== TODO ====

Sort out permissions/priveleges/users/pg_hba stuff
