=== Scripts as part of SGE4VFX ===

==== Install ====

First, go through the scripts and change the variables at the top to reflect
your database server details

==== gridsub (bash) ====

qsub submits jobs to sge, but because SGE doesn't care about the job once it's
done, the gridsub command wraps it and allows us to use another mechanism to
track the job.  I'm starting with a pretty basic Postgres DB.

Note1.  By using this method, it's important to pass all options to SGE by param
rather than putting them in the submission script so they can all be parsed.
Also, the script is not too clever so the submission script must be the last
parameter.

Note2.  I'm using Postgres rather than MySQL because people who know better than
me told me to.  I don't know enough about it to argue.

Try it with an example submission like this:

====== test.sh ======
#!/bin/sh

sleep ${SGE_TASK_ID}
echo "Slept"
=====================

gridsub -t 1-100 -N test_name test.sh


==== TODO ====

Write a python version of the gridsub script
