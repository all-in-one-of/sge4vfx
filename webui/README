Very initial at the moment.  Doesn't work but is very much a work in progress and should end up *much* faster than the original.

Uses the following:

https://github.com/FSX/momoko
http://initd.org/psycopg/
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/
https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/
http://jquery.com/
http://jqueryui.com/

and probably some other bits.  More to come.
