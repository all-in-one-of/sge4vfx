Fully working now.  Needs to be QA'd and then I'll merge it into master.
Should be pretty self contained so just needs to be dropped somewhere and
started.

At the moment I'm running it with supervisord backed onto nginx.

Uses the following:

http://www.tornadoweb.org/
https://github.com/bueda/tornado-boilerplate
https://github.com/FSX/momoko
http://initd.org/psycopg/
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/
https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/
http://jquery.com/
http://jqueryui.com/

and probably some other bits.  More to come.
