==== Install ====

===== SGE bits =====

apache (or whatever user it's running as, must be a manager in SGE so it can
delete jobs.  The machine the webserver's running on must be a submit host for
the same reason.

===== Postgres =====

You'll need to setup the database first.  Have a look at the README in the db
directory if you haven't already.

===== Apache =====

1) Set up an apache install somewhere and put these files either in the root or
a subdirectory
2) Make the cgi directory a ScriptAlias so the CGI stuff can be executed.
Here's an example httpd/conf.d/theq.conf

ScriptAlias /theq/cgi/ /wherever_it_is/cgi/
Alias /theq/ /wherever_it_is/

3) Reload/restart httpd/apache
5) In cgi/workers/qstat and qdel - put the path of your SGE settings.sh so that
the environment can be sourced (I'm sure there's a way to do this once in a file
elsewhere - anyone??)
6) In cgi/sgewebuisettings.py put your database settings

It should be working now if you point your browser at <webserver>/theq/
(assuming you used the example conf above).  It'll probably show nothing though
because there's nothing in the DB.  Have a look in the scripts directory for how
to submit.

==== ToDo ====

Multi-user support with a simple text input at the top for username
Caching qstat output
Task view

==== Notes ====

The UI currently only displays one user
It assumes everything is an array task
