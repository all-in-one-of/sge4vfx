==== License ====

As this (the contents of the webui folder) uses GPL components, the license
remains and is included in the LICENSE file

==== Install ====

===== SGE bits =====

apache (or whatever user it's running as, must be a manager in SGE so it can
delete jobs.  The machine the webserver's running on must be a submit host for
the same reason.

===== Postgres =====

You'll need to setup the database first.  Have a look at the README in the db
directory if you haven't already.

===== Memcached =====

Make sure memcache is installed and running on port 11211

===== Apache =====

1) Set up an apache install somewhere and put these files either in the root or
a subdirectory
2) Make the cgi directory a ScriptAlias so the CGI stuff can be executed.
Here's an example httpd/conf.d/theq.conf

ScriptAlias /theq/cgi/ /wherever_it_is/cgi/
Alias /theq/ /wherever_it_is/

3) Reload/restart httpd/apache
5) In cgi/workers/qstat and qdel - put the path of your SGE settings.sh so that
the environment can be sourced (I'm sure there's a way to do this once in a file
elsewhere - anyone??)
6) In cgi/sgewebuisettings.py put your database settings

It should be working now if you point your browser at <webserver>/theq/
(assuming you used the example conf above).  It'll probably show nothing though
because there's nothing in the DB.  Have a look in the scripts directory for how
to submit.

==== ToDo ====

Multi-user support with a simple text input at the top for username
Caching qstat output
Task view

==== Notes ====

It's worth noting that I've been developing almost entirely in Google Chrome
I've checked every now and then that it looks ok in Firefox, but it's certainly
not as pretty as in Chrome.  Just use Chrome :-)
It assumes everything is an array task
